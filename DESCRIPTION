Description: This package contains 2 functions, W_stat(), which computes the 
              exact probababilities of the Wilcoxon Sign Rank Test Statistic, W.
              The second function, Wilcox.m.test() allows the user to conduct the
              1-Sample Wilcoxon Sign Rank hypothesis test for medians, this also 
              allows the user to conduct the hypothesis test for
              the normal approximation.
